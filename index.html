<!-- 
    We can add read, write, and/or execute permissions by using the Bitwise OR 
    to the variable that is being checked/updated.
    We can check if a user has a certain permission using the if statements to compare the binary/decimal values of
     the permissions to what the value of the variable is.
    We can use bitwise operators for encryptions, graphics, communications, etc.
